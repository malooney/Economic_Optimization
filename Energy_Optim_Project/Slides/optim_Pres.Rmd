## Goal of this Research

###

* Develop a Quadratic Program to determine an optimal mix (portfolio) of energy supplies which minimize the variability of the price of energy in the Texas electricity market.

* I will use the "Modern Portfolio Theory", introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952.

* Model Energy Costs using Monte Carlo Simulation.

* When used in Electric Power System optimization modeling, Merlin and Back (1975) note that we are interested in both minimizing expected cost and minimizing risk. This is a multi-objective optimization problem and there is always a trade-off between these two objectives.

## Background

###

* **My study is focused exclusively on the Texas Electric Grid.**

* The Texas Grid is managed by The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

* ERCOT is a membership-based 501(c)(4) nonprofit corporation, governed by a board of directors and subject to oversight by the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the Texas Legislature.

* **(ERCOT) manages the flow of electric power to 24 million Texas customers -- representing about 90 percent of the state’s electric load.**

* ERCOT schedules power on an electric grid that connects more than 46,500 miles of transmission lines and 570+ generation units.

## Current ERCOT Service Area

## Changing Texas Electric Market

### ERCOT is currently undergoing rapid change in several key areas.

  * Demand Increase
    
  * Structural Change
    
  * Changes in Regulatory environment
    
  * Change in ERCOT’s Service Territory
  
  * Weather Uncertainty

## United States Power Grid

* Western Interconnection, ERCOT, Eastern Interconnection

## Demand Increse - Forcasted

* ERCOT Generated Model for Peak Summer Demand

![](/Users/malooney/Google Drive/digitalLibrary/*AAEC6305_Economic_Optimization/Economic_Optimization/Energy_Optim_Project/Graphs_and_Charts/peakDemand.png)

## Structural Change

### Energy source portfolio changes 

* More Wind and Solar sources online

* More Natural Gas integration

* Coal plant retirement schedules

### Demand Shifters

* Electric vehicles have less than 1% market share today

* The future will look very different

* The electricity demands from electric vehicles on the power grid will be non-trivial

* Turns out the future is hard to predict, BUT future demands need to be provisioned for today.


##Changes in Regulatory Environment

### Electricity Market Reform

* Move away from vertically integrated electricity markets

* Move toward Investor Owned Utilities (IOU's)

* Development of Spot Market and Day Ahead Transaction Markets

* More sophisticated Cost Plus Pricing Models

### Changes in Environmental Regulations

* Move toward renewable energy sources

* Move away from Nuclear and Coal

* Carbon Price Modeling

##Change in ERCOT’s Service Territory

* Lubbock will add 600 MW of demand load

## Weather Uncertainty

###

* Texas summers are always hot!!! and getting hotter???

## Optimization Model

### Quadratic Programing Model - General Formula

\[\mathop {\min }\limits_{{x_i}} \frac{1}{2}x_i'Hx_i + f'{\text{ subject to }}\left\{ \begin{gathered}
  Ax_i \leqslant b, \hfill \\
  Aeqx = beq, \hfill \\
  x_i \geqslant 0 \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}  \right.\]

## Strategy

### How have energy portfolios been modeled in the past?

* Measuring costs is the first step to the understanding of electricity mix.

* A common and useful measure to compare different electricity generating technologies is the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE).

* LCOE calculations are generally computed as point source estimates of costs. (U.S. Energy Information Admin. (EIA), DOE, National Renewable Energy Lab, LAZARD, Sandia National Lab)

* The calculation of the LCOE is based on the equivalence of the present value of the sum of discounted revenues and the present value of the sum of discounted costs (see for instance, Marrero and Ramos-Real, 2010).

## Strategy

### Levelized Cost of Electricity Formula

\[\begin{gathered}
  LCOE = \frac{{P + O{M_F}}}{{8760 \cdot {C_f}}} + {F_c} \cdot Q + O{M_v} \hfill \\
  P = {C_c}\left[ {i + \frac{i}{{{{(i + 1)}^n} - 1}}} \right] \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

$P$ is the yearly payment on capital costs.  
$OM_F$ is the fixed costs.  
8760 is the number of hours in a year.  
$C_f$ is the capacity factor.  
$F_c$ is the fuel cost.  
$Q$ is the heat rate of the plant.  
$OM_v$ is the variable costs.  
$C_c$ is the capital cost of building the generation plant or station.  
$i$ is the interest rate.  
$n$ is the number of payments, assumed to be the lifetime of the plant.

## Strategy

### My Approach in this Study

1.  Calculate LCOE by Monte Carlo Simulation.
    * Draw LCOE Cost Parameters from various statistical distributions.
    * Distributional choice is determined by historical data on costs across energy sources.
    * Collate point source data from EIA and LAZARD LCOE reports. Use the data to establish boundary conditions for the chosen distributions.

## Strategy

### My Approach in this Study

2.  Take random draws from the Multivariate Normal Distribution to construct a correlated error term across all energy source LCOE's.
    * Since most studies focus on point source estimates, little work has been done to evaluate the covariance structure between energy sources. Some correlation is assumed to exist within costs and interest rates. Using the MVN distribution
 allows us to model the unknown correlations across energy sources.
    
\[ \varepsilon  \sim {\mathcal{N}_p}(\mu ,\Sigma ) \]

\[LCO{E_{{\varepsilon _i}}} = LCO{E_i} + {\varepsilon _i}\]

## Strategy

### My Approach in this Study

3.  Use the Expected $LCO{E_{{\varepsilon _i}}}$ cost estimates from the Monte Carlo study along with the uncovered variance-covariance matrix to minimize the risk, (using a Quadratic Programming Model) of obtaining energy while satisfying the defined constraints.

## Optimization Model

### Model and Notation

\[\min \sum\limits_{i = 1}^6 {{{({\Sigma }{x_i})}^2}} {\text{     subject to:  constraints}}\]

## Optimization Model

### General Constraints

* 2022 Energy Demand

\[\sum\limits_{i = 1}^6 {{x_i}}  \geqslant d\]

* Maximum Expected Cost

\[\frac{{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^6 {{c_i}{x_i}} }}{{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^6 {{x_i}} }} \leqslant {c_{max}}\]

* Non-negativity

\[{x_i} \geqslant 0,{\text{     }}\forall i{\text{     }}\]

## Optimization Model

### Technical Constraints

* from Marrero, et al (2015); Awerbuch and Berger (2003); Awerbuch and Yang (2007); Marrero and Ramos-Real (2010)

  Sola{r_{PV}} \leqslant 7\%  \hfill \\
  Wind \leqslant 25\%  \hfill \\
  N{G_{Peaking}} \geqslant 10\%  \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

\[\begin{gathered}
  \left. \begin{gathered}
  {x_1} = N{G_{cc}} \leqslant 90\%  \hfill \\
  {x_2} = Coal \leqslant 90\%  \hfill \\
  {x_3} = Nuclear \leqslant 90\%  \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}  \right\}UpperLimit \hfill \\
  \left. {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^3 {{x_i}}  \geqslant 60\% } \right\}LowerLimit \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

## Optimization Model

### Practical Implementation in R

* Using "quadprog" algorithm
  * the algorithm expects the following format

\[\min \left( {\frac{1}{2}b'Db - d'b} \right){\text{  s.t.  }}A'b \geqslant b\]

* Enrich the LCOE calculations with additional parameters and better data.

* Model the variance-covariance using SUR.

* Model the LCOE using ARCH/GARCH modeling.
