# Economic_Optimization

Course Objective  
  
The purpose of the course is to study the applications of optimization models in economics. Our focus of study is to develop the ability to formulate economizing problems as well-defined optimization problems, solve them algebraically or with the aid of optimization software, and interpret the solutions. Theoretical development of optimization techniques is not emphasized in this course.
